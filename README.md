# Build your own Chatbot with Python and NLP

In this notebook, I will show you how to build your very own chatbot using Python and NLP. There are broadly two variants of chatbots, Rule-based and Self-learning.

A rule-based bot uses some rules on which it is trained, while a self-learning bot uses some machine-learning-based approach to chat.

In this notebook, I will show you how to create a simple and quick chatbot in python using a rule-based approach.

Libraries Used - NLTK Library in Python.

Thank You:)
